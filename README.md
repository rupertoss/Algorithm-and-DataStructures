This repository contains examples of using algorithms and data structures in programs written in Java.

Exercises are based on Coursera - Algorithms Part I.
Programs uses algorithms written by mentors in above-mentioned course.
These mentors are: Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne from Princeton University. 
For additional documentation, see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a>.

According to Coursera Honor Code, I decided to do not post tasks here so its will not be indexed by Google.
