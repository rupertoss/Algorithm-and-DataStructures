/**
 * Egg drop. 
 * 
 * Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) 
 * and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher 
 * and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine 
 * the value of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:
 * 
 * Version 0: 1 egg, <= T tosses.
 * Version 1: ~1lgn eggs and ~1lgn tosses. 
 * Version 2: ~lgT eggs and ~2lgT tosses.  
 * Version 3: 2 eggs and ~2 sqrt(n) tosses. 
 * Version 4: 2 eggs and <= c sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant c.
